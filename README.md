# Android-Project-Carpool
<p>My project being an Android Application for Car-Pooling among various users using CLOUD, Basically the particular application can be installed in any android phone,The goal of the project is to enable multiple users having different source location and wanting to reach a common destination or a location which falls in the same route .Which holds true for a Car-Pooling principle i.e to share a ride among    various  users.

Working:
 Step 1: A driver (User1) registers into a particular URL which is redirected to cloud and cloud stores all the relevant driver information. here to note is that AADHAAR CARD number is provided for security without providing it authentication of             driver  nor the passenger is valid.
 The info provided by user are name, phone, type of vehicle , vehicle number and num. of seats available. and for this a password is generated for the driver                              after  validation of the information for further transaction.
              
 Step 2 : the passenger(User2) then accesses this info and if optimal to his/her condition , interacts with the driver .
